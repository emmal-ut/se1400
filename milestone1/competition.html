        <h4>Who is my competition?</h4>
        <p>There are probably thousands of online sites that sell art prints, including the thousands of sellers on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=art%20prints&ref=search_bar" target="_blank">Etsy</a>.</p>
        <p>However, for the area that I am in, and my most likely audience, there are much less options.</p>
        <p><a href="https://petallane.com/" target="_blank">Petal Lane</a> is a local shop that sells art prints. They have lot's of different items, and a very cute style. However, they are geared mainly toward home decor.
        <p>I would like to be able to offer more than just wall prints. I would like to offer customizable printed items such as holiday cards, invitations, and other printed items.</p>
    <p>This is the only place, that I know of, that sells the same types of things in my area.</p>
